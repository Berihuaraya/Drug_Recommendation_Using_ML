# Drug_Recommendation_Using_ML
This is The Personal Desease Identification and Drug Recommendation System Using Machine learning.
This is the Supervised machine learning model since I used Lebled data from the kaggle. the Drug recommendation is based on the desease symptoms, drug used before, and current symptoms. 
This system is developed at Google Colab and made as a web app using Flask API.
In order to develop this system at google colab please export all the basic dataset from local storage to google drive. then use these datasets directley from google drive.
